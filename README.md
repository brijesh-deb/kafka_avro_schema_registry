# kafka_avro_schema_registry
- A sample that shows:
  - Usage of Confluent platform
  - Avro for serialization
  - Usage of Schema Registry
- Pre-requisite
  - Install Confluent Platform Community https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/cos-quickstart.html
- what happens behind the scene
  - The producer built the Kafka message using the User object
  - The producer registered the User schema with the schema registry to get a schema version ID, this either creates a new ID or reuses the existing one for that exact schema
  - Avro serialized the User object using the schema
  - The message was published on the topic with schema-id in message header
  - When the message came to the consumer, it read the schema-id from the header
  - The consumer used schema-id to get the User schema from the registry
  - The consumer found a local class that could represent that object and deserialized the message into it
